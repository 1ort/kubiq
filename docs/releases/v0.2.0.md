# Kubiq v0.2.0 Release Notes

Tag: `release/0.2.0`

## Highlights

- Added `order by` sorting with multi-key support and `asc|desc`.
- Added global aggregations in `select`: `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `avg` (without `group by`).
- Added best-effort server-side filtering pushdown for technically supported `where` predicates with safe client-side fallback.

## Query language and CLI behavior

- Sorting is applied after `where` filtering and before output formatting.
- Aggregation returns a single aggregated row.
- Aggregation constraints in `v0.2.0`:
  - `group by` is not supported.
  - `order by` is not supported together with aggregation.
  - `--describe` is not supported together with aggregation.
  - Aggregation expressions cannot be mixed with projection paths in one `select`.

## Diagnostics and correctness

- Pushdown/fallback behavior is transparent via typed diagnostics in `stderr`.
- Rejected selectors trigger fallback to list-without-selectors followed by client-side filtering (no false positives in final result set).
- Typed error hierarchy remains the primary contract for CLI/operator diagnostics.

## Testing and validation

- Unit suite is green (`cargo test -q`).
- E2E scenarios are covered for core resources and CRDs (`tests/e2e_minikube.rs`).

## Upgrade notes from v0.1.0

- Existing `where`/`select` flows remain supported.
- New optional capabilities are available:
  - `order by ...`
  - aggregation expressions in `select`
- Scripts and run instructions for local minikube workflows remain unchanged.
